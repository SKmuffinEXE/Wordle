This is my attempt at creating wordle in react

Wordlist is gotten from freedictionary.com

Try and guess the word before you run out of attempts!

Notes:  If you put in a guess with numerous of the same letter and there's only 1, all the letters will be highlighted regardless

Example:  
Answer: Arise
Guess: Arena

Despite there being only 1 'A' correct, both a's in arena will be highlighted
